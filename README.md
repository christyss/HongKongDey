# Hong Kong Dey 🇭🇰

Hello Everyone! Welcome to Hong Kong Dey. ✨ My name is Christy🙋🏻‍♀️.

Let me introduce you my background and also the idea that is related to it. I'm come from Hong Kong, I love my language and also the culture. I'd love them to live long. However, in these recent years due to the political issues, some schools are starting to replace Cantonese speaking classes to another language. We are worried that one day our mother tongue will be disappeared. Therefore, I decided to create an interactive app that could teach people Cantonese.

Since you are here, let's learn some Cantonese from this app. I believe that you will find Hong Kong Dey fun and informative. 🤗
