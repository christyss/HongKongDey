# Hong Kong Dey 🇭🇰

Hello Everyone! Welcome to Hong Kong Dey. ✨ My name is Christy🙋🏻‍♀️.

Let me introduce you my background and also the idea that is related to it. I'm come from Hong Kong, I love my language and also the culture. I'd love them to live long. However, in these recent years due to the political issues, some schools are starting to replace Cantonese speaking classes to another language. We are worried that one day our mother tongue will be disappeared. Therefore, I decided to create an interactive app that could teach people Cantonese.

Since you are here, let's learn some Cantonese from this app. I believe that you will find Hong Kong Dey fun and informative. 🤗

🌟Here is the home page of Hong Kong Dey. There are few options to bring you to different sessions.

🌟Here is one of examples of the learning session. 
Over the left side, there are chinese word and english word of the item in the picture.
On the right side, there are description of the item, and the audio player which has the Cantonese pronunciation of the word.
